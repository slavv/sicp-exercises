;Exercise 1.19. 
;There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number
;of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables a and b in the fib-iter process of
;section 1.2.2: a a + b and b a. Call this transformation T, and observe that applying T over and over
;again n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair Fib(n + 1) and Fib(n). In other words, the Fibonacci
;numbers are produced by applying Tn, the nth power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1,0).
;Now consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations Tpq, where Tpq
;transforms the pair (a,b) according to a bq + aq + ap and b bp + aq. Show that if we apply such a
;transformation Tpq twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation Tp'q' of the same form, and
;compute p' and q' in terms of p and q. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and
;thus we can compute Tn using successive squaring, as in the fast-expt procedure. Put this all together
;to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:41
;(define (fib n)
;(fib-iter 1 0 0 1 n))
;(define (fib-iter a b p q count)
;  (cond ((= count 0) b)
;        ((even? count)
;         (fib-iter a
;                   b
;                   <??> ; compute p'
;                   <??> ; compute q'
;                   (/ count 2)))
;        (else (fib-iter (+ (* b q) (* a q) (* a p))
;                        (+ (* b p) (* a q))
;                        p
;                        q
;                        (- count 1)))))

;Solution:

(define (fib n)
  (fib-iter 1 0 0 1 n))
(define (fib-iter a b p q count)
  (cond ((= count 0) b)
        ((even? count)
         (fib-iter a
                   b
                   (+ (* p p) (* q q))
                   (+ (* q q) (* 2 p q))
                   (/ count 2)))
        (else (fib-iter (+ (* b q) (* a q) (* a p))
                        (+ (* b p) (* a q))
                        p
                        q
                        (- count 1)))))
